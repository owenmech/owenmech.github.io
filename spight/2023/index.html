<p>Helen,</p>
<p>
    Happy birthday!!! I'm so excited you're finally 21 and I can't wait to go out to bars and stuff now!
    I've been really looking forward to this summer and I'm glad you're in town because we're gonna hang out so much.
    Literally just let me know if you're ever bored after work because I'm sure I will be too.
    Also I'm going to continue tradition of leaving you a digital note because my handwriting has surely deteriorated.
    And the fact that you left the tab open for so long really meant a lot and still makes me smile.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of work though, holy crap you deserve all the congratulations in the world, and I never doubted for a second you'd get the return offer.
    Having you as a producer this past year was such a pleasure and it's no wonder Riot (and even Rockstar) could tell you're a <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: gray">natural</span> skull-crusher.
    If I didn't think so before â€” which I obviously did, but even more so now â€” you absolutely deserve it.
    Your ability to be on top of everything, communicate effectively, and still be the nicest person ever blows me away.
    I know I'm repeating myself, but seriously, if you ever need a coder, hire me.
    It would be an honor.
</p>
<p>
    More importantly than that, I'm so so grateful to have you as a friend.
    I'm really excited to play instruments and write music with you this summer, but I'm not even upset that it rarely happens when you come over.
    Every time we say we're gonna practice drums or smoke or something, we end up just chatting for hours and I couldn't be happier.
    To say I appreciate having such a close friend with whom I can talk about literally anything is a massive understatement.
    From chord progressions to cultural politics, games experience to god's existence, nerdy shit to neurodiversity.
    (Okay I admit that was corny as fuck but it took some effort let me live).
</p>
<p>
    But for real, when I showed you that program for generating lists of words and how I ended up learning about pentatope numbers?
    Your response â€” and I'm never going to forget it â€” was "I love you what the fuck" with genuine enthusiasm.
    I made a joke about it at the time (that the 'normal' response would be to feign intrigue yet be put off) but it really stuck with me.
    That sort of hobby is not something I tend to share because of social-pressure-anxiety-perception-whatever, so
    I cannot express how happy it makes me to have someone to show.
    You always seem interested and make me feel supported and seen and understood.
    You're like actually the greatest friend I could ask for.
</p>
<p>
    I love you so much and I'm psyched to jam some more!
    I know I'm horrible at reaching out but I'm going to be better. Hold me to it.
    We're gonna make these next two months count because I'm gonna miss the hell out of you when I leave LA.
    You'll be the first to know when I inevitably (and hopefully frequently) come visit.
</p>
<p>
    Oh and I know you mentioned wanting to continue work on Splat Cat, so I hope you like the gift!
</p>
