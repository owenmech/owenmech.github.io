<p>Helen,</p>

    I honestly can't believe it's only been a year since the first time we literally had a conversation.
    It feels like we've been friends for ages and that makes me so excited for the next two years of school.
    I have such a good time whenever we hang out, and I swear we could just talk forever.
    Even if one of us is going through some shit, talking to you always makes me happier.
</p>
<p>
    I just want to say a massive thank you for being a part of my life.
    As you know I'm never the person to reach out, nor the person to open up on my own.
    For whatever reason, you saw something in me and made sure we became friends.
    For that, I genuinely cannot express how grateful I am.
    Back in October you wrote you had had a "<span style="text-decoration: underline">ph</span>at" friend crush,
    and looking back, I did too.
    You have become one of — if not the — closest friend I have at USC, and I owe that entirely to you.
</p>
<p>
    You've made such in incredible impact on my life and I love you so much.
    And when I say incredible, I don't mean lacking credibility.
    In all seriousness, you helped me navigate unfamiliar mental health issues, you helped me talk out my problems,
    you helped me deal with stupid drama, you helped me meet new people,
    you helped me land an AGP role, you helped me find new music...
    seriously what the fuck would I do without you? Probably suffer.
</p>
<p>
    You are such an amazing and fun and kind and loving human being who deserves all the hype in the world.
    You have so much passion and initiative and I respect you so goddamn much.
    Oh and don't forget me when you inevitably reach the very top of the industry.
    <span style="font-size: 0.4em">please I'll be your code monkey</span>
</p>
<p>
    Anyways I hope you have a wonderful birthday! And enjoy the new addition to the goose collection.
    I cannot wait to hang this summer and work together for the next year!
    I love you so so much <3
</p>
